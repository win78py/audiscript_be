 Questions 35 through 37 refer to the following conversation. Hello, I'm calling about a car I rented on Monday. I'm supposed to return it to the Springfield Airport on Sunday, but my travel plans changed, and I was wondering if I could drop the car off in Oakland instead. Sure, I can notify our Oakland branch that you'll return the car there. Great, thank you. Please be aware that the Oakland office closes early on Sundays, so you'll need to drop it off that afternoon by 2. Okay, I'll make sure to note that on my phone calendar. I don't want to pay any late fees. Number 35. Why is the man calling? Number 36. What does the woman warn the man about? Number 37. What will the man most likely do next?
